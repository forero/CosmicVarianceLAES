We derive constraints on the mass and occupation fraction of dark
matter halos hosting \ly Emitting galaxies (LAEs) at a redshift of
$z=3.1$, by comparing the number density and the angular
correlation function between mock and observed fields. The mock fields
are constructed in a large cosmological N-body simulation using a
model where a dark matter halo can only host one LAE with a
probability $f_{\rm occ}$  if its mass is within the mass range
delimited by two threshold values  $M_{\rm min}$ and $M_{\rm max}$. We
define three different families of parameters consistent with
observations based on their mass range
$\Delta M \equiv \log_{10}M_{\rm max} - \log_{10} M_{\rm min}$ dex and occupation
fraction $f_{\rm occ}$.  From this we conclude that the number
density and spatial clustering information available from observations
is not sufficient to derive a unique and narrow set of values for the
parameters in the model. In particular, it is always possible to find a 
a model with any desired occupation fraction in the range $0.1\leq
f_{\rm occ}\leq 1.0$.  However, there is a dominant family composed by
models with a narrow mass range $\Delta M<1.0$ dex, a low occupation fraction
$f_{\rm occ}\leq 0.3$ and a maximum mass $M_{\rm   max}<
10^{12}$\hMsun.  This suggests that the most massive dark matter halos
at that epoch do not host the brightest LAEs, also giving support to
some observational evidence indicating that only a small fraction of
star forming galaxies can be actually detected as LAEs. We provide
tables and mock catalogs for the successful models.

\section{Introduction}

Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) have become in the last decade
a  central topic in studies of structure formation in the Universe. They 
are helpful in a diverse range of fields. LAEs can be used as probes
of reionization \citep{Dijkstra11}, tracers of large scale structure
\citep{Koehler2007},  signposts for low metallicity stellar
populations, markers of the galaxy formation process through
cosmic history \citep{ForeroRomero2012}. and tracers of active star formation 
\citep{Guaita2013}

At the same time, theoretical and observational developments have
contributed to the emergence of a paradigm to describe structure
formation in a cosmological context. In this context it is considered
that dominant matter content of the Universe is to be found in dark
matter, whereby each galaxy is hosted by larger dark matter structure
known as a halo. \citep{Peebles1980}

Most models of galaxy formation find that the mass of the halo can be
used to predict properties of the galaxy such as its stellar mass and
star formation rate \citep{Behroozi2012}. Processes that regulate the
star formation cycle are also though to be strongly dependent on its
mass. Furthermore, the spatial clustering of galaxies on large scales
is entirely dictated by the halo distribution.  For the reasons
mentioned above, finding the typical dark matter halo mass hosting
LAEs represents a significant step forward to understand the nature of
this population in the context of Lambda Cold Dark Matter
($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm.  

Some theoretical approaches to this problem have been based on
ab-initio approach modeling. Starting from the DM halo population, the
corresponding intrinsic star formation properties are inferred
together with other statistics such as the luminosity function, the
correlation function and the equivalent width distributions. Such
modelling has been implemented from analytic considerations,
semi-analytic models  and  full N-body hidrodynamical simulations
\citep{Laursen2007, Dayal2009, ForeroRomero2011, Yajima2012, Orsi2012, Soler2012}. 

Added to the uncertainties in the astrophysical processes describing
star formation in galactic populations, a highly debated step in this
approach is the calculation of the fraction of \ly photons
that escape the galaxy to the observer. Given the resonant nature of
the \lya line, the radiative transfer of \ly is sensitive to the
density, temperature, topology and kinematics of the neutral Hydrogen
in the interstellar medium (ISM) \citep{Neufeld1991, ForeroRomero2011, Dijkstra2012,
Laursen2013,Orsi2012}.  

This complexity can be tackeld with monte-carlo simulations for the
radiative transfer a required tool to obtain physically sound results,
although the degeneracy in the physical parameters involved in the
problem makes it difficult to achieve a robust consensus on what is
the theoretical expected value for the \ly escape fraction
at high redshift. 

Our objective in the present \documentname is to use a method to
bypass all the complexity involved in the estimation of the \ly escape
fraction to infer information relevant to the understanding of LAEs in
a cosmological context. The analysis we present is thus based on one
of the most robust prediction of $\Lambda$CDM, namely the clustering
and abudance of dark matter halos. We construct a simple model that
allow us to construct mock catalogs and explore a wide range of
parameters to narrow the mass interval of halos hosting LAEs together
with its occupation fraction. 

Another central point in our study is the explicit inclusion of cosmic
variance effects by using large volume cosmological simulations. This
allows us to go closer to the space of observables and directly
explore the compatibility of a model with observations.

This paper is structured as follows. In the next section we present
the simulation and model used to produce the mock catalogs and the criteria
used to compare them against observations. In \SS \ref{sec:results} we
present the main results in terms of the parameters of our model. We
continue with a discussion of these results under the light of other
observational results for LAEs and abundance matching models for
galaxy formation before presenting our conclusions in \SS
\ref{sec:conclusions}. 

Throughout this \documentname we assume a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with the
following values for the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_{m}=0.27$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$ and $h=0.70$, corresponding to the matter
density, vacuum density and the Hubble constant in units of 100 km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. 

\section{Methodology}

Our method is based on the comparison of observatios and mock
catalogs on the surface number density and the angular correlation
function of LAEs.  In the next subsections we describe in detail the four key
elements of this workflow. First, we present the observations we take
as a benchmark. Second, the N-body simulation and the halo catalogs we
use. Third, the simplified model that allows us to translated halo
catalogs into mock LAE observations. Fourth, the statistics we use to
compare observational results against our theoretical predictions. 

\subsection{Observational Constraints}

One of the main observational benchmarks we use in this paper is the LAE number
density information at $z=3.1$ obtained by the panoramic narrow-band
survey presented by \cite{Yamada2012} from a survey
conducted with the Subaru 8.2m telescope and the Subaru Prime Focus Camera,
which has a field of view covering $34\times 27$ arcmin, corresponding to a
comoving scale of $46\times35$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ at $z=3.09$.  The narrow
band filter is centered at $4977$ \AA with  $77$\AA width,
corresponding to the redshift range $z=3.062-3.125$ and $41$ Mpc
$h^{-1}$ comoving scale for the detection of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line
centered at $z=3.09$. The authors reported a
total  $2161$  LAEs with an observed equivalent width larger than $190$\AA 
over a total survey area of $2.42$ deg$^{2}$ that includes 12 subfields, 
this corresponds to average surface number density of $0.20\pm 0.01$ arcmin$^{-2}$.   

The survey covered four independent fields. The first is the SSA22
field of $1.38$ deg$^2$ with $1394$ detected LAEs (7 subfields), this field has been
known to harbor a region with a large density excess of galaxies. The
second observed region is composed by the fields Subaru/{\it
  XMM-Newton} Deep Survey (SXDS)-North, -Center and -South, with a 
total of $0.58$ deg$^2$ and $386$ LAEs (3 subfields). The third and fourth fields
are the Subaru Deep Field (SDF) with $0.22$ deg$^2$ and $196$ LAEs (1 subfield),
and the field around the Great Observatory Optical Deep Survey North
(GOODS-N) with $0.24$ deg$^2$ and $185$ LAEs (1 subfield). 

There is abundant observational work done on LAEs at redshift $z=3.1$
\citep{Kudritzki2000,Matsuda2005,Gawiser2007,Nilsson2007,Ouchi2008}.
However, we decide to focus on the data from \cite{Yamada2012} because
it has the largest covered area with homogeneous instrumentation
conditions (telescope, narrow band filter), data reduction pipeline
and conditions to construct the LAE catalog. This ensures that the
number density variations among fields are \emph{not} due to different
observational conditions or criteria to construct the catalogs.

The second constraint is the angular correlation function
(ACF). \cite{Yamada2012} does not report an ACF measurement. Instead
we use the results by \cite{Hayashino2004} and
\cite{Ouchi2008,Ouchi2010}.  

\cite{Hayashino2004} observed in the densest field of
SSA22 while \cite{Ouchi2008} observed on a 1 deg$^2$ sky of the
Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS) Field.  There are some
differences between these observations and those iby
\cite{Yamada2012}. The details in the color selection, corresponding
limiting luminosities and EW thresholds are different in these
references. Nevertheless we use these observations as additional
constraints in spite of the fact that the first selected models are
based only on the surface density statistics by \citep{Yamada2012}.





\subsection{Simulation and Halo Catalogs}

The Bolshoi simulation \citep{Bolshoi} we use in this paper was
performed in a cubic volume of 250 $h^{-1}$ Mpc on a side. The
dark matter distribution is sampled using $2048^{3}$ particles, which
translates into a particle mass of $m_{\rm   p}=1.35\times 10^{8}$
$h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$.  The cosmological parameters are consistent with
a WMAP5 and WMAP7 data with a matter density $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.27$,
cosmological constant $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$, dimensionless Hubble constant
$h=0.70$, slope of the power spectrum $n=0.95$ and normalization of the
power spectrum$\sigma_{8}=0.82$ \citep{Komatsu2009,Jarosik2011}.  

We use halo catalogs constructed with a Friend-of-Friends (FOF)
algorithm with a linking length of 0.17 times the inter-particle
distance. The catalogs were obtained from the publicly available
Multidark database \footnote{{\tt
    http://www.multidark.org/MultiDark/}}
\citep{2011arXiv1109.0003R}. We focus our work on halos more massive
than $1\times 10^{10}$\hMsun that are resolved with at least $70$
particles, the reasons for this choice are explained in the next
section. 


\subsection{A Model to Populate Halos with LAEs}
\label{subsec:mocks}

In our model a dark matter halo can only host one LAE at most. 
There are three parameters in the model that decide whether a halo can host a
galaxy or not: the lower and upper bounds for the mass range $M_{\rm min}<
M_{\rm h} < M_{\rm max}$ where LAEs reside and the fraction $f_{\rm
  occ}$ of such halos that host a \emph{detectable LAE}. The reader
must keep in mind that the physical interpreation of the occupation
fraction $f_{\rm occ}$ convolves two things: the presence of a star
forming galaxy in a halo and its detectability as a LAE. We do not assign a
luminosity to each LAE. We are primarily interested in
constraining the halo mass range hosting detectable LAEs under the
conditions defined by \cite{Yamada2012}. In what follows we will describe by
the letter ${\mathcal M}$ a model defined by an specific choice of the
three scalar parameters $M_{\rm min}$, $M_{\rm  max}$ and $f_{\rm occ}$.  


For each model ${\mathcal M}$ we create a set of mock fields from
disjoint volumes in the simulation. Each volume has the same geometry
probed by Suprime-CAM and the narrow band filter, namely rectangular
cuboids of dimensions $46\times 35\times 41$ $h^{-3}$Mpc$^{3}$ where
the last dimension goes in the redshift direction. This corresponds to
a total area of $880$ arcmin$^{2}$ in each mock field. We construct a total
$5\times 7 \times 6=210$ of such volumes from a snapshot in the Bolshoi
simulation. In each mock field a LAE is assigned to the position of a
dark matter halo if the halo mass is in the range allowed by the model
$M_{\rm min}<M_{\rm h}<M_{\rm max}$ and a random variable taken from
an homogeneous distribution $0\leq \xi<1$ is smaller than the occupation
fraction $\xi<f_{\rm occ}$.

Next we construct mock surveys by making groups of $11$ mock fields
out of the $210$ available volumes. In total $15$ mock surveys are
constructed for each model $\mathcal{M}$. The grouping is done in two
different ways. In the first way, called {\texttt match}, we follow
the clustering of the observed fields. From the $11$ mock fields, $7$
are constructed from contiguous fields in the simulation to mimic the
SSA22 region, $3$ are also contiguous between them but not to the first
$7$ fields to mimic the SXDS fields and finally $2$ non-contiguous
fields to imitate the SDF and GOODS-North field. Our main goal with
this selection is to test the impact on the final statistics of having
$7$ clustered fields. The second way to group the mock fields is called {\texttt
  random}, whereby all the $11$ fields are selected in such a way as
to avoid that any two volumes are contiguous. In this \documentname we
only report the results obtained by the {\texttt match} method that
are also obtained in the {\texttt random} selection.





\subsection{Sampling and Selecting Models}

We make a thorough exploration of the parameter space for the models
${\mathcal M}$. $\log_{10} M_{\rm min}$ takes $30$ values from $10.0$ up
to $12.9$ with an even spacing of $0.1$ dex. $\log_{10} M_{\rm max}$
takes values in the same range as $\log_{10}M_{\rm min}$ only with a
displacement of $0.1$ dex in the whole range. The occupation fraction
$f_{\rm occ}$ takes $10$ different values from $0.1$ to $1$ regularly
spaced by $0.1$. In total the number of different models ${\mathcal
  M}$ that are explored is $30 \times 30 \times 10 = 9000$. 


The lower limit for the parameter $M_{\rm min}$ is set by the minium
occupation fraction we are able to consider. At $M_{\rm
  min}=10^{10}$\hMsun the halo number density is already $\sim 10$
times higher than the observational constraints for LAEs. This means
that models in that mass range and an occupation fraction $f_{\rm
  occ}$ have the possibility to be compatible with observations. Lower
values for $M_{\rm min}$ require $f_{\rm occ}<0.1$, which are not
considered in this \documentname. 

For each mock survey generated in a given model ${\mathcal M}$ we
compute the surface density in the $12$ mock fields. We perform a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) to compare this mock date against the $12$
observational values. From this test we obtain a value $0<P<1$ to
reject the null hypothesis, namely that two data sets come from the
same distribution. In this paper we consider that for values $P>0.05$
the two distributions can be thought as coming from the same
distribution.

We begin by considering that  a model ${\mathcal M}$ that has at least
one mock survey (out of 15) consistent with the observed
distribution of LAE number densities has viable parameters that
deserve to be considered for further analysis. Later on we impose
harder constraints to reduce the number of models by asking that all
the 15 mocks to be consistent with observations.




We then calculate the  angular correlation function (ACF)
for all the models having the $15$ mock surveys consistent with
observations . The ACF is computed  ( using 
the Davis \& Peebles  estimator \citep{Davis1983} ) only on the densest
subfield in all the 15 mock surveys corresponding to the SSA22
region. We then take the mean ACF over the 15  mock surveys  for
each model as well as its the standard deviation to include
the effect of cosmic variance. 

We finally compare the observational ACF and the mean mock  ACF of the models   
in therms of the angular correlation lenght ($\theta_{0}$) by fitting 
them to a power-law function:  

\begin{equation}
\omega(\theta) = \left(\frac{\theta}{\theta_{0}}\right)^{-\beta}
\label{eq:fitting}
\end{equation}

Both mock and observational ACF are derived by a least
square minimization procedure. The observational errors of 
the ACF as well as the standard deviation of the mean modelled ACFs  are
considered to compute the error in the fitted parameters to ensure ourselves
to include poissionian and cosmic-variance errors. 
We consider that a model is consistent with observations if the two parameters $\beta$ and $\theta_0$ are
equal within a $1$-$\sigma$ range.



 
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The main purpose of this section is to show how different
observational constraints narrow down the parameters space of allowed
models. In each one of the four sub-sections we add a new
constraint. First we consider the average halo number density, then we
consider the surface density distributions for all the mock fields in
a given mock survey. From this result we move to narrower constraints
by requiring a high number of mock surveys with consistent surface
density distributions to finally consider the impact of the angular
correlation function.

  $210$ volumes of dimensions $46\times 35\times 41$ h${-3}$Mpc$^{3}$
  in the Bolshoi simulation. The horizontal gray band represents the
  range of surface densities observed for LAEs at $z=3.1$ as reported
  by \citep{Yamada2012}.}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}


\subsection{Dark Matter Halo Number Density}

In Figure \ref{fig:halos} we present the results for  the
integrated dark matter halo surface density as a function of halo
mass. Each line corresponds to one of the 210 sub-volumes in the
Bolshoi simulation. The gray band indicates the surface density
values for LAEs allowed reported in observations \citep{Yamada2012}.
 
This result provides the basis to understand why only a specific range of models
${\mathcal M}$ can be expected to be consistent with
observations. From Figure \ref{fig:halos} we can read that models
with a minimum mass $\log_{10} M_{\rm min}>11.5$\hMsun \ will always have a
surface number density lower than the observational
constrain. This makes impossible that models with that minimum mass
can be compatible with observations.


The opposite is true in models with $\log_{10} M_{\rm min}<10.5$
that will show surface number density larger than observations, this
implies that in such models the occupation fraction has to be tuned
$f_{\rm occ}<1.0$ as to lower the halo number density to match the
gray band values.

In the next subsection we quantify this intuition by means of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests between mock surveys and observations.

\caption{$M_{\rm min}$-$M_{\rm max}$ (left) and $M_{\rm
    min}-f_{\rm occ}$ (right) planes for all models with
  $P>0.05$ in two different ways used to construct the mock
  surveys. The color code corresponds to the number of mock surveys
  that are found to be compatible with observations in terms of the KS
  test with $P>0.05$. Only regions of parameter space with at least
  one consistent mock survey are included. \label{fig:landscape}}   
\end{figure*}


Figure \ref{fig:landscape} presents regions in parameter space $M_{\rm
min}-M_{\rm max}$, $M_{\rm min}-f_{\rm occ}$ where the KS test yields
values of $P>0.05$ at least for one mock survey. For those models it
is not possible reject the hypothesis that the simulated and observed
data for the surface number density come from the same parent
distribution.

The upper (lower) panels correspond to the {\texttt match} ({\texttt
  random}) method to build the mock surveys from individual
fields. The plot shows number of mock surveys consistent
with observations. There are between $550$ to $600$ models out of the
original $9000$ models that have at least one mock survey
consistent with observations. 


In Figure \ref{fig:landscape} there are three regions of parameter
space that can be clearly distinguished. The first region corresponds
to models where the minimum mass is high $\log_{10}M_{\rm min}>
11.5$. None of this models is compatible with observations as expected
from the results in the previous subsection. For these models the number
density of LAEs is too low compared to observations.

The second region corresponds to an intermediate range for the minimum
mass $10.5<\log_{10}M_{\rm min}<11.5$ where regardless of the value of
the maximum mass $M_{\rm max}$ it is possible to tune the occupation
fraction $f_{\rm occ}$ to bring some of the mock observations into
good agreement with observations. In this region in parameter space
one can thus find two extreme kinds of models.  One kind where the
mass interval is very narrow with sizes smaller than $<0.3$ dex (a
factor of two in mass) and others where the mass interval is 
extended (larger than $1.0$ dex) going up to the maximum halo mass
present in the simulation at that redshift (up to $2.5$ dex). 

The third region in parameter space corresponds to $\log_{10}M_{\rm
  min}<10.5$. In this case only models with a very narrow mass interval of
at most $0.5$ dex ($\log_{10}M_{\rm max}<11.0$) and low
occupation fractions $f_{\rm occ}<0.3$ are allowed. 

Without any additional information our method allows us to infer that
most of the successful models are found in the second and third region of
parameter space where this result was already expected from halo
abundance calculations shown in Figure \ref{fig:halos}. In the next
section we reduce the size of this region by imposing tighter
constraints on the KS tests and consistency with the angular
correlation function.

  realizations that are consistent with observations.
  \label{fig:high_success_rate}.}  
\end{figure*}
 
\subsection{Models with the highest success rates}

For each model ${\mathcal M}$ there are 15 different mock surveys. In the
previous section we presented the models that had at least one
mock survey with $P>0.05$.

Figure \ref{fig:high_success_rate} shows the number of models
that have at least $N_{\rm high-P}$ mocks with $P>0.05$ for both the
{\texttt  match} and {\texttt random} methods.  This shows that there
are between $80$ to $100$ models with all the 15 realizations with
$P>0.05$. Selection of these models as successful represents a
reduction of a factor of $\sim 6$ with respect to the total number of
mocks with at least one consistent mock.  

Figure \ref{fig:restriction_mock} presents the locii of these models
in the parameter space $M_{\rm min}-M_{\rm max}$ and $M_{\rm
  min}-f_{\rm occ}$. The results are very similar between the {\texttt
  match} and {\texttt random} methods. With this constraints the
number of consistent models with  $\log_{10}M_{\rm min}< 11.5$ are
greatly reduced. This corresponds to the regions in the parameter
space in Figure \ref{fig:landscape} that already had a low number of
consistent mock surveys. On the other hand, from the right panel in
Figure \ref{fig:restriction_mock} one can see that there is not a
strong constraint on the occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}$.

Figure \ref{figure:correlation_parameters} shows the main results in a
$\theta_{0}-\beta$  plane where the average and standard deviation
for each mock is shown in comparison with the result derived from
observations.  The error bars in this Figure represents the standard
deviation of the ACF over all the sub-fields in the 15 mock
observations. These error bars are larger than the statistical
uncertainty from the fitting procedure on a single field.

In the left panel Figure \ref{figure:correlation_parameters} we see how
the observational ACF measured by \cite{Hayashino2004} (green dot) is
successful in reducing the total number of possible models. Only those
with angular-correlation length within
$15^{\prime\prime}<\theta_{0}<23^{\prime\prime}$ are considered to
reproduce observations.    


In order to better illustrate the results from this test we
show in the right panel of Figure \ref{figure:correlation_parameters} 
the plane $\theta_{0}$-$M_{\rm min}$ for all models. There we divide
the models into two disjoint sets: those with $\log_{10} M_{\rm
    max}<12$ (blue dots) and $\log_{10} M_{\rm
    max}>12$ (green dots). The colored rectangle includes
the parameter region which is consistent with the observational
constraint in $\theta_{0}$. With this restriction we find that most
models with $\log_{10} M_{\rm max}>12$ and  $\log_{10} M_{\rm min}>11.1$ 
can be safely ruled out.  



In Figure \ref{fig:restriction_mock_and_f_occ_corr} we present the preferred
models in the planes $M_{\rm min}-M_{\rm  max}$ and $M_{\rm min}-f_{\rm occ}$
for the {\tt match} method after applying the observational constraints 
in the occupation fraction and the ACF. Here we consider a model
consistent if there is an overlap of $1-\sigma$ in its values for the
correlation length $\theta_0$ and the power $\beta$ in the
correlation function.  As before, we found similar results using the {\tt random} method


\section{Discussion}

Matching the galaxy surface number density statistics to
our mock  data sets the median
mass of all successful models in the range $(10^{10}-10^{12})$
\hMsun. Including more strict criteria on the number of mock surveys
that must be consistent with those observations and additional
information from the angular correlation function greatly reduces the
number of possible models. We end up with $\sim 50$ models out of the
initial 9000 possible combination of parameters.  

We find that to make a physical interpretation of these models it is
useful to do it in terms of the size of halo mass range. We now use the
variable $\Delta M=\log_{10}M_{\rm max} - \log_{10}M_{\rm  min}$, together
with the occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}$ to help us build a classification
of all the successful models into three families: 


\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Low $f_{\rm occ}\leq 0.3$ and low $\Delta M\leq 1.0$
  dex: 24 models.
\item[(2)] Low $f_{\rm occ}\leq 0.3$ and high $\Delta M > 1.0$dex: 11
  models
\item[(3)] High $f_{\rm occ}> 0.3$ and low $\Delta M\leq 1.0$: 14 models
\end{itemize}

There is a clear majority of models with a narrow $\Delta M\leq
1$, compared to the $2.5$dex of halo mass available for occupation at
that redshift. Such models imply that there is a cut at lower and higher halo
masses that render inefficient the presence and/or detection of LAEs.

At the low mass end, such cut can be readily interpreted in terms of the
minimal halo star formation rate needed to produce the necessary \lya
luminosity to be above a given detection threshold.  However, under
the reasonable assumption of star formation rate increasing with halo
mass, the cut at higher halo masses requires a different
explanation. There are two different physical scenarios to explain
this. 

One possible interpretation can be made in terms of a decreasing escape
fraction of \ly radiation in massive systems. There are detailed models for
radiative transfer that support the idea that massive galaxies with
higher metallicities have larger dust contents and less concentrated
ISM than lower mass systems which, due to the resonant nature of the
\ly line that increase the probability of absortion  of\ly photons, produce
high absorption of \ly photons but not of continuum or
other n-resonant lines \citep{ForeroRomero2011,Laursen2009}.  

A second scenario is that larger systems have more extended gaseous
envelopes which, due to resonance effects of the \ly line, leading to
a low surface brightness and a broader line, making these systems less
observable in narrow band filter surveys \citep{Zheng2010}. 

The preference for narrow $\Delta M$ ranges to hosting LAEs together
with the minor presence of reasonable models with $M_{\rm max}>
10^{12}$\hMsun \  shows that our models support theoretical and observational
insights where the most massive systems are not bright \ly sources
\citep{ForeroRomero2012}, \citep{Shapley2003}

\subsection{Comparison against results from blind surveys}

We also find that $70\%$ of the best models are found in families (1)
and (2), with a low occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}\leq 0.3$. This
preference goes in the same direction as the observational constraint
on the escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}\sim 0.1-0.2$ derived at $z=2.2$ by \cite{Hayes2010}
and recent theoretical study of observational data in a wide redshift
range $0<z<6$  \citep{Dijkstra2013}.  

The observational estimation by \cite{Hayes2010} was based on blind
surveys of the H$\alpha$ and Lyman $\alpha$ line. Using corrections by
extinction to obtain an estimate for the intrinsic H$\alpha$
luminosity, and using values for the theoretical expectation of the
ratio Lyman$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ they derive an bulk escape fraction for
the Lyman$\alpha$ radiation of $f_{\rm esc}=(5.3\pm 3.8)\%$ or $f_{\rm
  esc}=(10.7\pm 2.8)\%$ if a different dust correction is used. 

They also showed that that the luminosity function for LAEs at $z=2.2$ is
consistent with the escape fraction being constant for every galaxy
regardless of its luminosity. From this results they derive that
almost $90\%$ of the star forming galaxies emit insufficient
Lyman $\alpha$ to be detected, effectively setting the occupation
fraction to be $f_{\rm occ}=0.10$.  

\cite{Dijkstra2013} used a similar principle to derive their results. They
compared observationally derived star formation functions to LAE
luminosity functions. At $z\sim 3.0$ they derive an effective escape
fraction of $f_{\rm esc}=(17\pm 5)\%$ could be interpreted as an
occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}\sim 0.2$.  We consider a success of
our method the fact that we find that most of the consistent models
show a low occupation fraction.    



\subsection{Comparison to other clustering estimates}

Observational based on the ACF inferred from photometric measurements
in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South have shown that the median
dark matter masses of h los hosting LAEs is $\log_{10}M_{\rm
  med}=10.9^{+0.5}_{-0.9}$\Msun, with a corresponding occupation
fraction of $1-10\%$  \citep{Gawiser07}.  Our results are in a general
good agreement with those estimates for the host mass. This is not
completely unexpected given that we have also required consistency
with ACF measurements.   

The novelty in our approach is that we have a detailed estimate for 
host halo mass range together with the escape fraction. This allows us
to demonstrate that the halo mass range could be very narrow $\Delta M <
0.2$dex, something that cannot be inferred from ACF analysis
alone. 

We also find interesting that our ACF analysis is also not enough to rule
out models with a high occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}>0.3$, which
represent almost one fourth of our best models, coinciding with a wide
range in halo masses $\Delta M>1.0$ dex. These models can only be
considered unfavorable based on the density and abundance observations
as we have described in the previous subsection.


\cite{Ouchi2010} presents an analysis of LAE observations in the
redshift interval $3.1<z<7.0$. At $z=3.1$ They get to an average
mass for the host dark matter halos of $M_{h}=2.9^{+24.0}_{-2.9}\times
10^{10}$ \hMsun with a corresponding duty cycle of $0.008\pm
0.03$. This broadly matches the expectations from the first family of
models, also summarized in Table \ref{table:firstfamily}. In
particular it seems to favor only the very low occupations fractions.  




\subsection{In the context of abundance matching models}


Considering the additional evidence for a low escape fraction and 
assuming a direct relation between $f_{esc}$ and $f_{occ}$ we can
say that the preferred models are in families (1) and (2) with a
clear majority composed by those with narrow mass range.

Abundance matching methods throughout cosmic time from redshifts
$0<z<8$ \cite{Behroozi2013a,Behroozi2013b} work based on observational
results for Lyman Break Galaxies. In those studies the minimum halo
mass considered to be relevant in their analysis is
$10^{11.4}$\hMsun. For that mass, \cite{Behroozi2013a} report a
stellar mass mass around $(1.0\pm0.3)\times 10^{9.0}$
\hMsun, while their star formation rate is in the range $0.6\pm 0.2$
Msun yr$^{-1}$, which nevertheless are close to the lower bound of
values inferred for LAEs at high redshift
\citep{Gawiser2007,Nilsson2009,Pentericci2009}.  





In our results, all the preferred models have a halo mass range lower
than the minimum of $M_{\rm min}<10^{11.4}$\hMsun considerend in
abundance matching at $z=3$. This mass scale is also strictly superior to
the great majority of  $M_{\rm max}$ values allowed in the models with
low escape fraction.   This suggests that a detailed and careful study
of the spectral and photometric properties of LAEs coupled to the kind
of analysis performed in this paper can be a guide in the study of the
properties of low mass dark matter halos at $z=3.1$, extending the
capabilities of abundance matching methods.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this \documentname we constrain the preferred mass
and occupation fraction of dark matter halos hosting Lyman Alpha Emitters at
redshift $z=3.1$ in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use a method that
matches the cosmic variance of the surface 
density number of LAEs between mock and real observations and is also
consistent with estimations of the angular
correlation function. The mock catalogs are constructed using a 
model with three basic parameters: the halo mass range where LAEs can
be found, $M_{\rm   min}<M_{\rm h}<M_{\rm   max}$, and the fraction of
the halos in this range that host a detectable LAE, $f_{\rm occ}$. After
a thorough exploration of the parameter space we find that a wide
variety of models are consistent with the observational constraints,
where only a minority has been considered so far in the
literature. Out of $9000$ initial combinations for the model
parameters we end up with $49$ successful arrangement of parameters.


The most important conclusion of this work is that available
observational information for the clustering properties of LAEs at
$z=3.1$ does not provide enough constraints to uniquely narrow the range of masses
and occupation fraction of dark matter halos hosting those
galaxies. In particular we are not able to put a stringent constraint
on the occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}$.

In our results the models can be split into three families
depending the mass range $\Delta M=\log_{10}M_{\rm max} -
\log_{10}M_{\rm min}$ and the occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}$. The first family is narrow both in
$\Delta M$ and $f_{\rm occ}$, a second family is only narrow in
$\Delta M$ and the third is narrow in $f_{\rm occ}$ and broad in
$\Delta M$. 


All the halo mass ranges in the best models fall into the broad
range obtained in previous analysis \citep{Gawiser2007}. The
improvement of our method is being able to describe in high detail
all the possible models consistent with observations, including the
discovery of models previously overlooked like those with a high
occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}>0.3$.
 

A central result in this exploration of parameter espace is the
existence of a large number of models with a very
narrow mass range $\Delta M< 0.1$ dex that are consistent in every
aspect with the spatial distribution of observed LAEs. In order to
have these characteristics it is required that halos around the mass
$M_{\rm max}$ for each model become inefficient in hosting detectable
galaxies. One way to achieve this is having LAEs with a decreasing \ly
escape fraction with increasing mass. 

All the models also present a range of masses where the halos are
below the mass scale of $10^{11.4}$\hMsun \  inferred as a lower
threshold for the LBGs used in halo abundance matching
studies. Detailed study of high-z LAES will have a positive impact on
our understanding of the connection of low mass halos to star forming
galaxies.

We foresee that the new observations with new instruments (such as MUSE,
Hyper SuprimeCam and HETDEX) covering larger fields and a wider range
of luminosities will be key in imposing tighter constraints on the
properties of dark matter halos hosting LAEs.

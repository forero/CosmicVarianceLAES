We derive constraints on the mass and occupation fraction of dark
matter halos hosting \ly Emitting galaxies (LAEs) at a redshift of
$z=3.1$ by matching the number density and the angular
correlation function between mock and observed fields. We explicitly
take into account the cosmic variance on the typical observed field size by
constructing mock fields from a large cosmological N-body
simulation matching the observational geometries. To populate the
halos in the simulation we use a model where a dark matter halo with
mass in the range $M_{\rm   min}<M_{\rm h}<M_{\rm max}$ can only host
one LAE with a probability $f_{\rm occ}$.  We find that the observational information on the number density restricts the minimum mass to a
range $10^{10}\hMsun < M_{\rm min}< 10^{11.5}\hMsun$ leaving all the
other parameters unrestricted, while the clustering information puts a
tight constraint of $M_{\rm   max}<10^{12}\hMsun$. This gives support
to the idea that the most massive dark matter halos at that epoch do
not host the brightest LAEs.  However, none of these observations is
able to constrain the occupation fraction. It is always possible to
find a model that is consistent with observations and has any desired
occupation fraction in the range $0.1\leq f_{\rm occ}\leq
1.0$. Furthermore, all models have a mass range $\Delta M \equiv
\log_{10}M_{\rm max} - \log_{10} M_{\rm min}$ smaller than 1.0 dex. 
We divide the best models into families of low and high occupation
fraction with a transition around $f_{\rm occ}\leq 0.3$. These two
families are almost disjoint in their values of $M_{\rm min}$. Low
occupation fraction occurs below a threshold of $M_{\rm th}=
10^{10.8}\Msun$, while high occupation fractions are present in
$M_{\rm min}>M_{\rm the}$. These two families of models are
similar in size, giving an unconclusive response as to which is the
occupation fraction of LAEs at $z=3.1$. A conclusive answer requires
a detailed physical model for the  connection between dark matter,
star formation and the escape of \ly radiation. That kind of modelling
should also provide a plausible explanation for the narrow range in
mass $\Delta M<1.0$ dex derived here for the halos hosting LAEs at
$z=3.1$.

\section{Introduction}

Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) have become in the last decade
a  central topic in studies of structure formation in the Universe. They 
are helpful in a diverse range of fields. LAEs can be used as probes
of reionization \citep{Dijkstra11}, tracers of large scale structure
\citep{Koehler2007},  signposts for low metallicity stellar
populations, markers of the galaxy formation process through
cosmic history \citep{ForeroRomero2012} and tracers of active star
formation  \citep{Guaita2013}

At the same time, theoretical and observational developments have
contributed to the emergence of a paradigm to describe structure
formation in a cosmological context. In this context it is considered
that dominant matter content of the Universe is to be found in dark
matter (DM), whereby each galaxy is hosted by larger dark matter structure
known as a halo. \citep{Peebles1980,SpringelNature05}.

Most models of galaxy formation find that halo mass can be
used to predict galaxy properties such as the stellar mass and
star formation rate \citep{Behroozi2012}. Processes that regulate the
star formation cycle are also though to be strongly dependent on its
mass.  For these reasons, finding the typical dark matter halo mass
hosting LAEs represents a significant step forward to understand the
nature of this galaxy population in the context of Lambda Cold Dark
Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm.    

Some theoretical approaches to this problem have been based on
ab-initio approach. Starting from the DM halo population, the
corresponding intrinsic star formation properties are inferred
together with other statistics such as the luminosity function, the
correlation function and the equivalent width distributions. Such
modelling has been implemented from analytic considerations,
semi-analytic models  and  full N-body hidrodynamical simulations
\citep{Laursen2007, Dayal2009, ForeroRomero2011, Yajima2012, Orsi2012,
  Soler2012}.  

In addition to the uncertainties in the astrophysical processes
describing star formation in galactic populations, is the calculation
of the fraction of \ly photons that escape the galaxy to the observer
is another debated step. Given the resonant nature of the \ly line,
the radiative transfer of \ly is sensitive to the density,
temperature, topology and kinematics of the neutral Hydrogen in the
interstellar medium
(ISM). \citep{Neufeld1991,ForeroRomero2011,Dijkstra2012,Laursen2013,Orsi2012}.     

This problem can be tackled with Monte Carlo simulations for the
radiative transfer, however the complexity of the relevant physical
processes makes it difficult to achieve a robust consensus on what is
the theoretical expected value for the \ly escape fraction
at high redshift. 

Another approach to infer the typical DM halo mass of halos hosting
LAEs is based on the spatial information. This uses the fact that in cold
dark matter cosmologies the spatial clustering of galaxies on large
scales is entirely dictated by the halo distribution
\citep{Colberg00}, which in turn has a strong dependence on halo
mass. Using measurements of the angular correlation function of LAEs,
observers have put constraints on the typical mass and occupation
fraction of the putative halos hosting these galaxies
\citep{Hayashino2004,Gawiser07,Nilsson2007,Ouchi2010}. In this
studies the observations were done on single fields of $\sim 1$
deg$^{2}$ and the conclusions derived on the halo host mass from
clustering information do not delve to deeply into the impact of
cosmic variance.

Recently \cite{Yamada2012} observed a wide area a bit more than ten
times the sky area covered so far by individual campaigns. The
observations were done with the same instrument and same criteria to
reduce the observational data and produce LAE catalogs. This large
data-set allows us to make the first study on the expected cosmic
variance effects in LAEs at $z=3.1$ and its impact on the
determination of the halo mass and occupation fraction. 


In this \documentname to study the impact of cosmic variance,
we implement a method to populate the DM halos in cosmological
simulations with LAEs. This approach bypasses all the uncertainty
involved in the estimation of star formation rates and \ly escape
fraction. The model only considers whether a DM can host a
detectable LAE or not. It does not predict a \ly  luminosity. Once the
mock catalogs are constructed  we proceed with a direct comparison
against the statistics derived from observations. This allows us 
to find the preferred mass range of DM halos hosting these galaxies
and its occupation fraction.




This \documentname is structured as follows. In the next section we present
the simulation and model used to produce the mock catalogs and the criteria
we use to compare them against observations. In \S \ref{sec:results} we
present the main results for the halo mass and occupation fraction. We
continue with a discussion of these results under the light of other
observational and theoretical results. Finally, we present our
conclusions in \S \ref{sec:conclusions}. 

Throughout this \documentname we assume a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with the
following values for the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_{m}=0.27$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$ and $h=0.70$, corresponding to the matter
density, vacuum density and the Hubble constant in units of 100 km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. 

\section{Methodology}


Our method is based on the comparison of observations and mock
catalogs. We use two different kinds of statistics to perform the
comparison: (i) the distribution of the surface number density
across fields fields and (ii) the angular correlation function measured in
some fields.

In the next subsections we describe in detail the four key
elements of this work-flow. First, we present the observations we take
as a benchmark. Second, we describe the main characteristics of the
N-body simulation and the halo catalogs we use. Third, we recount the
important parameters of the simplified model that we use to populate
the halo catalogs with LAEs. Finally we describe some of the
statistical tests we adopt to compare observations and mocks.

\subsection{Observational Constraints}

The first observational constraint we use in this paper is the LAE number
density information at $z=3.1$ obtained by the panoramic narrow-band
survey presented by \cite{Yamada2012} from a survey
conducted with the Subaru 8.2m telescope and the Subaru Prime Focus Camera,
which has a field of view covering $34\times 27$ arc-min, corresponding to a
comoving scale of $46\times35$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ at $z=3.09$.  The narrow
band filter used in the survey is centered at $4977$ \AA with  $77$\AA width,
corresponding to the redshift range $z=3.062-3.125$ and $41$ Mpc
$h^{-1}$ comoving scale for the detection of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line
centered at $z=3.09$. The authors reported a
total  $2161$  LAEs with an observed equivalent width, in the observer
frame, larger than $190$\AA 
over a total survey area of $2.42$ deg$^{2}$ that includes 12 sub-fields, 
this corresponds to average surface number density of $0.20\pm 0.01$
arcmin$^{-2}$.    

The survey covered four independent fields. The first is the SSA22
field of $1.38$ deg$^2$ with $1394$ detected LAEs (7 sub-fields), this
field has been known to harbor a region with a large density excess of
galaxies. The second observed region is composed by the fields Subaru/{\it
  XMM-Newton} Deep Survey (SXDS)-North, -Center and -South, with a
total of $0.58$ deg$^2$ and $386$ LAEs (3 sub-fields). The third and
fourth fields are the Subaru Deep Field (SDF) with $0.22$ deg$^2$ and
$196$ LAEs (1 sub-field), and the field around the Great Observatory
Optical Deep Survey  (GOODS-N) with $0.24$ deg$^2$ and $185$ LAEs (1
sub-field).  

There is abundant observational work done on LAEs at redshift $z=3.1$
\citep{Kudritzki2000,Matsuda2005,Gawiser2007,Nilsson2007,Ouchi2008}.
However, we decide to focus on the data from \cite{Yamada2012} because
it has the largest covered area with homogeneous instrumentation
conditions (telescope, narrow band filter), data reduction pipeline
and conditions to construct the LAE catalog. This ensures that the
number density variations among fields are \emph{not} due to different
observational conditions or criteria to construct the catalogs.

The second constraint is the angular correlation function
(ACF). \cite{Yamada2012} does not report an ACF measurement. Instead
we use the results by \cite{Hayashino2004} and
\cite{Ouchi2008,Ouchi2010}. \cite{Hayashino2004} observed in the
densest field of SSA22 while \cite{Ouchi2008} observed on a 1 deg$^2$
sky of the SXDS Field.  There are some differences between these
observations and those by \cite{Yamada2012}. The details in the color
selection, corresponding limiting luminosities and EW thresholds are
different in these references. Nevertheless we use these observations
as additional constraints in spite of the fact that the first selected
models are based only on the surface density statistics by
\citep{Yamada2012}.  


\subsection{Simulation and Halo Catalogs}

The Bolshoi simulation \citep{Bolshoi} we use in this paper was
performed in a cubic volume of 250 $h^{-1}$ Mpc on a side. The
dark matter distribution is sampled using $2048^{3}$ particles, which
translates into a particle mass of $m_{\rm   p}=1.35\times 10^{8}$
$h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$.  The cosmological parameters are consistent with
a WMAP5 and WMAP7 data with a matter density $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.27$,
cosmological constant $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$, dimensionless Hubble constant
$h=0.70$, slope of the power spectrum $n=0.95$ and normalization of the
power spectrum$\sigma_{8}=0.82$ \citep{Komatsu2009,Jarosik2011}.  

We use halo catalogs constructed with a Friend-of-Friends (FOF)
algorithm with a linking length of 0.17 times the inter-particle
distance. The catalogs were obtained from the publicly available
Multidark database \footnote{{\tt
    http://www.multidark.org/MultiDark/}}
\citep{2011arXiv1109.0003R}. For each halo in the box we store its
position in the box (3-D coordinates) and FOF mass. We focus our work
on halos more massive than $1\times 10^{10}$\hMsun that are resolved
with at least $70$ particles, the reasons for this choice are
explained in the next sub-section.  


\subsection{A Model to Populate Halos with LAEs}
\label{subsec:mocks}



\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,angle=0]{./plots/Figure0.pdf}
\caption{ \label{fig:distros} Spatial distribution of a LAEs mock
  survey for a model with parameters $\log_{10}M_{\rm min}=10.4$, $\log_{10}M_{\rm
    max}=10.5$ and $f_{\rm occ}=0.1$ for the {\texttt match}
  method. The larger panel shows $7$ mock
  fields together mimicking the SSA22 region. The intermediate panel
  shows $3$ mock fields corresponding to the SXDS region. The lower
  panels represent the SDF and GOODS-North fields. The same model has
  another 14 associated mock surveys build from different regions in
  the simulation, but constructed following the same pattern in the
  {\texttt match} method.}
\end{center} 
\end{figure*}


We assume that a dark matter halo can only host one
detectable LAE at most.  There are three parameters that
decide whether a halo host a LAE: the lower and upper bounds for the
mass range $M_{\rm min}< M_{\rm h} < M_{\rm max}$ where LAEs reside and the fraction $f_{\rm occ}$ of such halos that host a detectable LAE. The reader
must keep in mind that the physical interpretation of the occupation
fraction $f_{\rm occ}$ convolves two phenomena: the presence of a star
forming galaxy in a halo and its detectability as a LAE.  We do not
peform a explicit modeling for LAE detectability. Our model does not
assign a luminosity or escape fraction to each LAE.  We are only
interested in constraining the halo mass range hosting detectable LAEs
under the conditions defined by \cite{Yamada2012}.  


In what follows we note by the letter ${\mathcal M}$ a model
defined by a particular choice of the three scalar parameters $M_{\rm
  min}$, $M_{\rm  max}$ and $f_{\rm occ}$. For each model ${\mathcal
  M}$ we create a set of mock fields from disjoint volumes in the
simulation. Each volume has the same geometry probed by Suprime-CAM
and the narrow band filter, namely rectangular cuboids of dimensions
$46\times 35\times 41$ $h^{-3}$ Mpc$^{3}$ where the last dimension goes
in the redshift direction. This corresponds to a total area of $880$
arcmin$^{2}$ in each mock field. We construct a total $5\times 7
\times 6=210$ of such volumes from a snapshot in the Bolshoi
simulation. In each mock field a LAE is assigned to the position of a
dark matter halo if the halo mass is in the range allowed by the model
$M_{\rm min}<M_{\rm h}<M_{\rm max}$ and a random variable taken from
an homogeneous distribution $0\leq \xi<1$ is smaller than the occupation
fraction $\xi<f_{\rm occ}$.

Next we construct mock surveys by making groups of $12$ mock fields
out of the $210$ available volumes. In total $15$ mock surveys are
constructed for each model $\mathcal{M}$. The grouping of the $12$
mock fields into a mock catalog is done in two different ways. The
first is called {\texttt match}, it follows the clustering of the
observational fields. From the $12$ mock fields, $7$ are constructed
from contiguous fields in the simulation to mimic the SSA22 region,
$3$ are also contiguous between them but not to the first $7$ fields
to mimic the SXDS fields and finally $2$ non-contiguous fields to
imitate the SDF and GOODS-North field.  The second way to group the
mock fields is called {\texttt   random}, whereby all the $12$ fields
are selected in such a way as to avoid that any two volumes are
contiguous. In this \documentname we only report the results obtained
by the {\texttt match} method and mention explicitly differences
observed with the {\texttt random} selection. 

We note that we use $15\times 12=144$ mock fields out of the total of $210$
available sub-volumes. The reason is that the {\texttt match}
method imposes constraints on the way the $7$ fields mimicking the
SSA22 can be distributed, making unusuable some of the
sub-volumes in the box. We decide to keep the number of mock surveys
fixed to $15$ also for the {\texttt random} method in order to allow a
fair comparison between the two methods.




\subsection{Exploring and Selecting Good Models}

We make a thorough exploration of the parameter space for the models
${\mathcal M}$. $\log_{10} M_{\rm min}$ takes $30$ values from $10.0$ up
to $12.9$ with an even spacing of $0.1$ dex. $\log_{10} M_{\rm max}$
takes values in the same range as $\log_{10}M_{\rm min}$ only with a
displacement of $0.1$ dex in the whole range. The occupation fraction
$f_{\rm occ}$ takes $10$ different values from $0.1$ to $1$ regularly
spaced by $0.1$. In total the number of different models ${\mathcal
  M}$ that are explored is $30 \times 30 \times 10 = 9000$. 


The lower limit for the parameter $M_{\rm min}$ is set by the minium
occupation fraction we are able to consider. At $M_{\rm
  min}=10^{10}$\hMsun the halo number density is already $\sim 10$
times higher than the observational constraints for LAEs. This means
that models in that mass range and an occupation fraction $f_{\rm
  occ}=0.1$ have the possibility to be compatible with observations. Lower
values for $M_{\rm min}$ require $f_{\rm occ}<0.1$, which are not
considered in this \documentname. 

For each mock survey generated in a given model ${\mathcal M}$ we
compute the surface density in the $12$ mock fields. We perform a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) to compare this mock data against the $12$
observational values. From this test we obtain a value $0<P<1$ to
reject the null hypothesis, namely that two data sets come from the
same distribution. In this paper we consider that for values $P>0.05$
the two distributions can be thought as coming from the same
distribution.

We begin by considering that  a model ${\mathcal M}$ that has at least
one mock survey (out of 15) consistent with the observed
distribution of LAE number densities has viable parameters that
deserve to be considered for further analysis. Later on we impose
harder constraints to reduce the number of models by asking that all
the 15 mocks to be consistent with observations.

The second constraint  comes from the angular correlation function (ACF)
for all the models having the $15$ mock surveys consistent with
observations . The ACF is computed  ( using 
the Landy \&  Szalay  estimator \citep{Landy1993} )  on two kinds of
fields in the mock survey: the densest and one corresponding to the
average density. The first with the \cite{Hayashino2004}  and \cite{Ouchi2010}
ACFs respectively. 

The observational ACF and the  mock  ACF of the models are compared   
in terms of the correlation length ($\theta_{0}$) by fitting 
them to a power-law function:  

\begin{equation}
\omega(\theta) = \left(\frac{\theta}{\theta_{0}}\right)^{-\beta}
\label{eq:fitting}
\end{equation}

Both mock and observational ACF are derived by a least square
minimization procedure. For each mock we obtain a covariance matrix
that gives us the uncertainty in the parameters $\beta$ and
$\theta_0$. We compute a mean value for the parameters and its
associated uncertainty as the cuadratic average of the uncertainties in
the fitting procedure. We consider that a model is consistent with
observations if the two parameters $\beta$ and $\theta_0$ are equal
within a $1$-$\sigma$ range.  



 
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The main purpose of this section is to show how different
observational constraints narrow down the parameters space of allowed
models. Each sub-sections presents the effect of adding new pieces of
observational or statistical evidence. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.10\linewidth,angle=0]{./plots/Fig1.pdf}
\caption{ \label{fig:halos} Surface density of dark
  matter halos as a function of a minimum halo mass to count the
  total number of elements in a volume. Each line represents one of the
  $210$ volumes of dimensions $46\times 35\times 41$ h${-3}$Mpc$^{3}$
  in the Bolshoi simulation. The horizontal gray band represents the
  range of surface densities observed for LAEs at $z=3.1$ as reported
  by \citep{Yamada2012}.}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}


\subsection{Dark Matter Halo Number Density}

In Figure \ref{fig:halos} we present the results for  the
integrated dark matter halo surface density as a function of halo
mass. Each line corresponds to one of the 210 sub-volumes in the
Bolshoi simulation. The gray band indicates the surface density
values for LAEs allowed reported in observations \citep{Yamada2012}.
 
This result provides the basis to understand why only a specific range of models
${\mathcal M}$ can be expected to be consistent with
observations. From Figure \ref{fig:halos} we can read that models with
a minimum mass $\log_{10} M_{\rm min}>11.5$\hMsun will always have a
surface number density lower than the observational
constrain. This makes impossible that models in that range can be
compatible with observations, there are simply to few halos compared
to observed LAEs.


The opposite is true in models with $\log_{10} M_{\rm min}<10.5$ that
have a surface number density larger than observations. In those cases
the occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}<1.0$ can be tuned in order to
lower the halo number density to match observations.


Figure \ref{fig:halos} also illustrates the impact of cosmic
variance. At fixed mass there is an scatter of $0.3-0.6$ dex in the
mass range $10^{10}\hMsun < M_{\rm  min}<10^{11}\hMsun$.  A consequence of
this variation is that models with the same mass range and occupation
fraction can have mock fields with number densities varying up to a
factor of $\sim 2-5$. Also, the scatter in mocks across the simulation
is comparable to the $0.3$ dex scatter in observations.  


In the same Figure \ref{fig:halos} we see that at fixed number
density, around the range allowed by observations, there is an scatter
in the masses of $0.4-0.5$ dex. This intrinsic scatter in the masses
with a given number density adds is also included in the mock
construction process, enlarging the range of possible models
consistent with observations.

  compatible with observations. Only regions of parameter  space with
  at least one consistent mock survey are  included. \label{fig:landscape}}     
\end{figure*}


Figure \ref{fig:landscape} presents regions in parameter space $M_{\rm
min}-M_{\rm max}$, $M_{\rm min}-f_{\rm occ}$ where the KS test yields
values of $P>0.05$ at least for one mock survey, which is the most
conservative assumption for agreement between a model and observations. For those models it
is not possible reject the hypothesis that the simulated and observed
data for the surface number density come from the same parent
distribution. In total, there are between $550$ to $600$ models out of
the original $9000$ models that have at least one mock survey
consistent with observations. By inspection of Figure
\ref{fig:landscape} we see that the halo number abundance is able to
constraint the minimum mass $M_{\rm min}$ to a narrow range, while
$M_{\rm max}$ and $f_{\rm occ}$ remain unconstrained.

In Figure \ref{fig:landscape} there are three regions of parameter
space that can be clearly distinguished. The first region corresponds
to models where the minimum mass is high $\log_{10}M_{\rm min}>
11.5$. None of these models is compatible with observations as expected
from the arguments presented in the previous subsection. For these
models the number density of LAEs is too low compared to
observations. 

 
The second region corresponds to an intermediate range for the minimum
mass $10.5<\log_{10}M_{\rm min}<11.5$ where, regardless of the value of
the maximum mass $M_{\rm max}$, it is possible to tune the occupation
fraction $f_{\rm occ}$ to bring some of the mock observations into
good agreement with observations. In this region of parameter space
one can find two extreme kinds of models.  One kind where the
mass interval $\Delta M\equiv \log_{10} M_{\rm max} - \log_{10}M_{\rm
  min}$ is narrow with $\Delta M<1.0$ dex, others where the mass interval is 
extended $\Delta M>1.0$dex going up to the maximum halo mass
present in the simulation at that redshift, up to $\Delta M = 2.5$ dex
in some cases.  
 
The third region in parameter space corresponds to $\log_{10}M_{\rm
  min}<10.5$. In this case only models with a very narrow mass interval of
at most $0.5$ dex ($\log_{10}M_{\rm max}<11.0$) and low
occupation fractions $f_{\rm occ}<0.3$ are allowed. 

Without any additional information our method allows us to infer that
most of the successful models are found in the second and third regions of
parameter space. This result was already expected from halo
abundance calculations shown in Figure \ref{fig:halos} and discussed
in the previous subsection. 

However, the additional information we gain with this test is the
relative abundance of models in the parameter space. Not all the
models in the second region have an equal abundance. By inspection of
Figure \ref{fig:landscape} it seems that models with $\log_{10}M_{\rm
  min}\sim 10^{11.3}$\hMsun and low occupation fraction $f_{\rm}<0.3$
are preferred.  In the next sub-section we explore in detail the
models in this region, imposing tighter constraints on the KS test
results and exploring the mocks' consistency with the angular correlation
function.

  \label{fig:high_success_rate}.}  
\end{figure}
 
\subsection{Models with the largest number of consistent mock surveys}

In the previous Section we present a conservative criterion of
agreement by selecting the models that had at least one mock survey
with $P>0.05$ in the KS test. Now we turn to a more strict selection
by requiring all constructed mock surveys to be consistent with
observations. 


Figure \ref{fig:high_success_rate} shows the number of models
that have at least $N_{\rm high-P}$ mocks with $P>0.05$. For each
model ${\mathcal M}$ there are 15 different mock surveys.  We discard
the models that have 14 mocks or less consistent with
observations. With this cut we find $\sim 100$ models with all the 15
mock survey realizations with $P>0.05$.  This cut represents a
reduction by a factor of $\sim 6$ with respect to the total number of
models with at least one consistent mock.   

Figure \ref{fig:restriction_mock} presents the locii of these models
in the parameter space $M_{\rm min}-M_{\rm max}$ and $M_{\rm
  min}-f_{\rm occ}$. With this constraints the
number of consistent models with  $10.5 < \log_{10}M_{\rm min}< 11.0$ are
greatly reduced. This corresponds to the regions in the parameter
space in Figure \ref{fig:landscape} that already had a low number of
consistent mock surveys. On the other hand, from the right panel in
Figure \ref{fig:restriction_mock} one can see that there is not a
strong reduction on the favored values for the occupation fraction
$f_{\rm occ}$. 

We conclude that conditions on the number density statistics, even if they are
very strict, only put strong constraints on the minimum mass $M_{\rm
  min}$ but not on the other two parameter of the model $M_{\rm max}$
and $f_{\rm occ}$. In the next section we use additional observational
information to constrain these paremeters.

\end{figure*} 


Figure \ref{fig:correlation_parameters} shows the main results in a
$\theta_{0}-\beta$  plane where the average and standard deviation
over the mocks is shown in comparison with the result derived from
observations.  The error bars in this Figure represents the standard
deviation of the ACF over all the 15 mock fields used to make the
computation.  These error bars are larger than the statistical
uncertainty from the fitting procedure on a single field. 

In the left panel Figure \ref{figure:correlation_parameters} we see
how the observational ACF measured by \cite{Hayashino2004} (green dot)
is successful in reducing the total number of possible models. Only
those with angular-correlation length within
$15^{\prime\prime}<\theta_{0}<23^{\prime\prime}$ are considered to
reproduce observations. The right panel of Figure
\ref{figure:correlation_parameters} shows the results for fields in
the mock catalog that have an average number density that are compared
against the fit of the data reported by \cite{Ouchi2010}. In this case
we find that there are large uncertainties in the observational data,
however it is possible to discard a fraction of the models.


In Figure \ref{fig:restriction_mock_and_f_occ_corr} we present the preferred
models in the planes $M_{\rm min}-M_{\rm  max}$ and $M_{\rm min}-f_{\rm occ}$
both for the comparisong against \cite{Hayashino2004} and
\cite{Ouchi2010}. To make this selection we consider that
a model is consistent with observations if there is a $1-\sigma$
overlap between both the correlation length $\theta_0$ and the power
$\beta$. We clearly see from this Figure that the conditions imposed
by \cite{Hayashino2004} are the tightest. Comparing this Figure with
the results shown in Figure \ref{fig:restriction_mock} we see that
practically all models with $M_{\rm max}>10^{12}$ are removed. On the
other hand the comparison against \cite{Ouchi2010} does not succeed in
greatly reducing the number of models.

At this point we keep the models that are consistent with both
observational constraints. This basically reduces the selection to the
models already restricted by the data in \cite{Hayashino2004} as
presented in the lower panels of Figure
\ref{fig:restriction_mock_and_f_occ_corr}. Our main conclusions after
this comparison is that clustering information is able to put
meaningful constraints on the values of $M_{\rm max}$. However, the
possible values for the occupation fraction are still in the initial
range $0.1\leq f_{\rm occ}\leq 1$.



%In order to better illustrate the results from this test we
%show in the right panel of Figure \ref{figure:correlation_parameters} 
%the plane $\theta_{0}$-$M_{\rm min}$ for all models divided in two
%disjoint sets. The first are the models $\log_{10} M_{\rm
%    max}<12$ (blue dots), the second corresponds to $\log_{10} M_{\rm
%    max}>12$ (green dots). The colored rectangle includes
%the parameter region which is consistent with the observational
%constraint in $\theta_{0}$.  With this restriction we find that most

%models with $\log_{10} M_{\rm max}>12$ and  $\log_{10} M_{\rm min}>11.s$ 
%can be safely ruled out.  





\section{Discussion}

In the Results Section we start by matching the rough numbers for the
galaxy surface number density. This sets the median mass of all
successful models to the broad range $(10^{10}-10^{12})$ \hMsun for
$M_{\rm min}$ and $M_{\rm max}$. We include additional criteria on the
number of mock surveys that must be consistent observations
and the information from the angular correlation function, reducing
the number of feasible models. We end up with $\sim 50$ models out of
the initial $9000$ possible combination of parameters. 

In order to make a physical interpretation of these models we use 
the halo mass range, defined as $\Delta M=\log_{10}M_{\rm max} -
\log_{10}M_{\rm  min}$, together with the occupation fraction $f_{\rm
  occ}$ to classify all the successful models into three families:  


\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Low $f_{\rm occ}\leq 0.3$ and low $\Delta M\leq 1.0$
  dex: 24 models.
\item[(2)] Low $f_{\rm occ}\leq 0.3$ and high $\Delta M > 1.0$dex: 11
  models
\item[(3)] High $f_{\rm occ}> 0.3$ and low $\Delta M\leq 1.0$: 14 models
\end{itemize}

There is a clear majority of models with a narrow $\Delta M\leq
1$, compared to the $2.5$dex of halo mass available for occupation at
that redshift. Such models imply that there is a cut at lower and higher halo
masses that render inefficient the presence and/or detection of LAEs.

At the low mass end, such cut can be readily interpreted in terms of the
minimal halo star formation rate needed to produce the minimal \ly 
luminosity to be above a given detection threshold.  However, under
the reasonable assumption of star formation rate increasing with halo
mass, the cut at higher halo masses requires a different
justification. There are two complementary physical scenarios that can
provide an explanation.

One scenario can be presented in terms of a decreasing escape
fraction of \ly radiation in massive systems. There are detailed models for
radiative transfer that support the idea that massive galaxies with
higher metallicities have larger dust contents and less concentrated
ISM than lower mass systems. Due to the resonant nature of the
\ly line the probability of absorption  of \ly photons increases in
massive systems, producing high absorption of \ly photons but not of
continuum or other non-resonant lines
\citep{Laursen2009,ForeroRomero2011}. 

A second scenario is that larger systems have more extended gaseous
envelopes which. Again, due to resonance effects of the \ly line,
these systems can present a low surface brightness and a broader line,
making these systems less observable in narrow band filter surveys
\citep{Laursen2009,Zheng2010}.  

The preference for narrow $\Delta M$ ranges to host LAEs 
and the small presence of reasonable models with $M_{\rm max}>
10^{12}$\hMsun follows theoretical and observational
insights where the most massive systems are not bright \ly sources
\citep{ForeroRomero2012,Shapley2003}. 

\subsection{Comparison against results from galaxy surveys}

We also find that $70\%$ of the best models are found in families (1)
and (2), with a low occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}\leq 0.3$. This
preference goes in the same direction as the observational constraint
on the escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}\sim 0.1-0.2$ derived at $z=2.2$ by
\cite{Hayes2010} and recent theoretical study of observational data in
a wide redshift range $0<z<6$  \citep{Dijkstra2013}. 

The observational estimation by \cite{Hayes2010} was based on blind
surveys of the H$\alpha$ and Lyman $\alpha$ line. Using corrections by
extinction to obtain an estimate for the intrinsic H$\alpha$
luminosity, and using values for the theoretical expectation of the
ratio Lyman$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ they derive an bulk escape fraction for
the Lyman$\alpha$ radiation of $f_{\rm esc}=(5.3\pm 3.8)\%$ or $f_{\rm
  esc}=(10.7\pm 2.8)\%$ if a different dust correction is used. 

They also showed that that the luminosity function for LAEs at $z=2.2$ is
consistent with the escape fraction being constant for every galaxy
regardless of its luminosity. From this results they derive that
almost $90\%$ of the star forming galaxies emit insufficient
Lyman $\alpha$ to be detected, effectively setting the occupation
fraction to be $f_{\rm occ}=0.10$.  

\cite{Dijkstra2013} used a similar principle to derive their results. They
compared observationally derived star formation functions to LAE
luminosity functions. At $z\sim 3.0$ they derive an effective escape
fraction of $f_{\rm esc}=(17\pm 5)\%$ could be interpreted as an
occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}\sim 0.2$.  We consider a success of
our method the fact that we find that most of the consistent models
show a low occupation fraction.    



\subsection{Comparison to other clustering estimates}

Observational based on the ACF inferred from photometric measurements
in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South have shown that the median
dark matter masses of h los hosting LAEs is $\log_{10}M_{\rm
  med}=10.9^{+0.5}_{-0.9}$\Msun, with a corresponding occupation
fraction of $1-10\%$  \citep{Gawiser07}.  Our results are in a general
good agreement with those estimates for the host mass. This is not
completely unexpected given that we have also required consistency
with ACF measurements.   

The novelty in our approach is that we have a detailed estimate for 
host halo mass range together with the escape fraction. This allows us
to demonstrate that the halo mass range could be very narrow $\Delta M <
0.2$dex, something that cannot be inferred from ACF analysis alone. 

We also find that an ACF analysis on a single data-set is not enough to rule
out models with a high occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}>0.3$, which
represent almost one fourth of our best models, coinciding with a wide
range in halo masses $\Delta M>1.0$ dex. These models cannot be
considered unfavorable based on a clustering analysis only.

\cite{Ouchi2010} presents an analysis of LAE observations in the
redshift interval $3.1<z<7.0$. At $z=3.1$ They quote an average
mass for the host dark matter halos of $M_{h}=2.9^{+24.0}_{-2.9}\times
10^{10}$ \hMsun with a corresponding duty cycle of $0.008\pm
0.03$.  This broadly matches the expectations from the first family of
models, also summarized in Table \ref{table:firstfamily}. In
particular it seems to favor only the very low occupations
fractions. 

We conclude this section by noting that the uncertainties on
the preferred masses in \citep{Gawiser07} and \cite{Ouchi2010} are
found with in the intervals $M_{\rm min}$ and $M_{\rm max}$ of our
models. Under the light of our model, this implies that detected LAEs
must be absent from the most massive dark matter halos at that
redshift.



\subsection{In the context of abundance matching models}


The abundance matching methods are based on observational results for Lyman Break Galaxies
\citep{Behroozi2013a,Behroozi2013b}  (LBG).  In the case of
\cite{Behroozi2013a} the minimum halo mass considered to be relevant
in their analysis is $10^{11.4}$\hMsun. They report  stellar mass mass
around $(1.0\pm0.3)\times 10^{9.0}$ \hMsun, while their star formation
rate is in the range $0.6\pm 0.2$ Msun yr$^{-1}$, which nevertheless
are close to the lower bound of values inferred for LAEs at high
redshift \citep{Gawiser2007,Nilsson2009,Pentericci2009}.

In our results, all the preferred models have a halo mass range lower
than the minimum of $M_{\rm min}<10^{11.4}$\hMsun considered in
abundance matching at $z=3$. Thus confirming the expectations of LAEs
to be found in less massive halos than those for LBGs.

A detailed analysis of the spectral and photometric properties of LAEs
coupled to the kind of analysis performed in this paper can be a guide
in the study of the properties of low mass dark matter halos at
$z=3.1$, extending the capabilities of abundance matching methods.

\subsection{Caveats of our method}

There are two important caveats for the work presented here. The first is the
assumption of a single LAE per dark matter halo. It is expected
for sub-halos in the simulation to host satellited galaxies. However,
it has been found in analysis based on the shape of the correlation
function \citep{Jose2013b} that satellite galaxies are not a dominant
population, making our initial approximation a reasonable one.


The second caveat are the precise values for the mass intervals. These
numbers are defined from the halos defined in using the BDM halo
finder with a density threshold of 200 times the critical
density. Different halo finders and definitions for the detection
density threshold can yield different masses up to a factor. For
instance a Friends-of-Friends algorithm with linking lenght $l=0.20$
times the average interparticle distance finds halos on average $1.4$
times more massive than BDM halos \citep{Bolshoi}. Therefore, the mass
values for $M_{\rm min}$ and $M_{\rm max}$ must be considered exact
within $\sim 0.2$ dex.




\subsection{On the reproducibility of our results}

All the software, raw data and processed data to produce the results
and plots in this paper are publicly available in a github
repository \footnote{https://github.com/forero/CosmicVarianceLAES}. Most
of the code to produce the plots can be found as an Ipython notebook
\citep{IPython} in the same repository.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this \documentname we look for constraints on the preferred mass
and occupation fraction of dark matter halos hosting Lyman Alpha Emitters at
redshift $z=3.1$ in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform this study
paying attention to the impact of cosmic variance in these results. We
build a large number of mock catalogs matching observational
geometries. The mocks are constructed from a N-body simulation
following a simple recipe to assign a single LAE to each halo. Only
a fraction $f_{\rm occ}$ of halos with a mass range  $M_{\rm
  min}<M_{\rm h}<M_{\rm   max}$ can host a LAE. We proceed with a
thorough exploration of the space of free parameters $M_{\rm min},
M_{\rm max}$ and $f_{\rm occ}$ to find mocks that are consistent with
two observational constraints: the surface number density and the
angular correlation function. Out of the initial $9000$ 
combinations of parameters in the model we find $49$ arrangements
consistent with observations.


The successful parameter arrangements present a wide range of possibilities for
DM hosting LAE hosts at $z=3.1$. This means that the available LAEs' spatial
information is not sufficient to put a tight constraint on the mass
and occupation fraction of DM halos hosting LAEs. In particular it is
not possible to put a strong constraint on the occupation
fraction. Such a wide range in solutions is facilitated by the large
dispersion in the statistics derived from the mocks. All the halo mass
ranges and occupation fractions deduced in previous analysis in
previous analysis \citep[i.e.][]{Gawiser2007,Ouchi2010} are a subset of the
models we find in this \documentname.  
 

Nevertheless, the successful models can be split into three families
depending the mass range $\Delta M=\log_{10}M_{\rm max} -
\log_{10}M_{\rm min}$ and the occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}$. The
first family is narrow both in $\Delta M$ and $f_{\rm occ}$, a second
family is only narrow in $\Delta M$ and the third is narrow in $f_{\rm
  occ}$ and broad in $\Delta M$. 

 
We find a large number of models with a narrow mass range
$\Delta M<1.0$ dex that are consistent in every aspect with the
spatial distribution of observed LAEs. In order to have this characteristic
it is required that halos around the mass $M_{\rm   max}$ for each
model become inefficient in hosting detectable LAEs. Two conditions
can explain this. The first is having LAEs with a decreasing \ly
escape fraction with increasing mass, the second is having larger screening
effects by neutral Hydrogen around the most massive systems
\citep{Laursen2009,ForeroRomero2011}.  

A third aspect that stands out is the existence of a dominant family
of models with narrow $\Delta M<1.0$, as described before, and also a
low occupation fraction $f_{\rm occ}<0.3$. This gives support to the
common wisdom stating that only a small fraction of star forming
galaxies can be detected as strong LAEs. 

However, there are extreme cases with a very narrow $\Delta M<0.3$, meaning that
there is barely a factor of $\sim 2$ between the minimum and halo
mass. If these models turn out to be confirmed, this would be a great
challenge for galaxy formation models to explain how is that LAEs can
be hosted in such a narrow range of halo mass.

In summary, we show how current observations of LAEs cannot
put a tight constraint on the physical models. We  foresee that the
new observations with new instruments (such as MUSE, Hyper SuprimeCam
and HETDEX) covering larger fields and a wider range of luminosities
will be key in imposing tighter constraints on the properties of dark
matter halos hosting LAEs.

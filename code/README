Step by step guide to reproduce the results in the paper

1. Run python generate_mock_LAEs.py with generate_data =True.
   This will generate all the values of the number of LAEs for given
   set of M_min and M_max for an occupation fraction f_occ = 1.

2. Run python mock_survey.py with generate_data = True.
   This will generate mock surveys indexing the sub-boxes that will
   be included.

3. Run python p_value_distributions with generate_data = True.
   This will compute the p-value distributions for all the models in all
   the mock surveys.
